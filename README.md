Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.

Answer:
```swift
var colors = ["orange","red","yellow","turqoise", "lavender"]

print("\(colors[0]), \(colors[2]), and \(colors[4]) are some of my favorite colors")
```

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`

Answer:
```swift
var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]
let illinois = "Illinois"
let kansas = "Kansas"
var newStates: [String]  = []

for state in westernStates {
if state == illinois || state == kansas {
continue
}
newStates.append(state)
}
print(newStates)
```

## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`

Answer:
```swift
let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]

let hawaii = "Hawaii"
let alaska = "Alaska"

for state in moreStates {
if state == hawaii || state == alaska {
print("\(state): IS NOT in the continental United States.")

print("\(state): IS in the continental United States.")
}
}
```

## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`

Answer:
```swift
let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"
let space = " "
var myStringNoSpace = ""

for character in myString {
if String(character) == space {
continue
} else {
myStringNoSpace += String(character)
}
}
print(myStringNoSpace.count)
```

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`

Answer:
```swift
let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]
let space = " "
var myStringNoSpace = ""

outer: for quote in myFavoriteQuotes {
inner: for character in myFavoriteQuotes {
if String(character) == space {
continue
} else {
myStringNoSpace += String(character)
}
}
print("'\(quote)' has \(quote.count) non-whitespace characters in it.")
}
```

## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the `basket`. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
```

Answer:
```swift
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
let flower = "ðŸŒ·"
let dirt = "dirt"

for (index, plot) in garden.enumerated() {

basket.append(plot)
garden[index] = "dirt"
}
plot.replacingOccurrences(of: flower, with: dirt)
}

print(basket.count)
```

## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`

Answer:
```swift
var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]
let newPlayer = "Suzuki"
var newSome = [String]()

//Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
battingLineup.append(newPlayer)

//Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
for (index, player) in battingLineup.enumerated() {
if player == "Jeter" {
battingLineup[index] = "Tejada"
}
}

//Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
for (index, player) in battingLineup.enumerated() {
if player == "Thomas" {
battingLineup[index] = "Guerrero"
}
}

//Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.
for (index, player) in battingLineup.enumerated() {
if player == "Reyes" {
battingLineup.remove(at: index)
}
}
battingLineup.insert("Reyes", at: 7)

print(battingLineup)
```


## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
```

Answer:
```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 9

numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

print(numbers.contains(target))
```

## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
Answer:
```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}
var largestValue = 0

for number in arrayOfNumbers {
if number > largestValue {
largestValue = number
}
}

print(largestValue)
```

## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
Answer:
```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}
var smallestValue = 200

for number in arrayOfNumbers {
if number < smallestValue {
smallestValue = number
}
}

print(smallestValue)
```

## Question 10

var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]
var oddNumbers = [Int]()

for number in secondListOfNumbers {
if number % 2 != 0 {    //odd
oddNumbers.append(number)
}
}
print(oddNumbers)
```

## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

Answer:
```swift
var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var sum = 0

for number in thirdListOfNumbers {
sum += number
}
print(sum)
```

## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

Answer:
```swift
var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var sum = 0

for number in thirdListOfNumbers {
if number % 2 == 0 {
sum += number
}
}
print(sum)
```

## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
```

Answer:
```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()

var commonElements = (listOne.filter(listTwo.contains))

for number in commonElements {
sharedElements.append(number)
}

print(sharedElements.count)
```


## Question 14

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
```
Answer:
```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []

for number in dupeFriendlyList {
if noDupeList.contains(number) {
continue
}
noDupeList.append(number)
}

print(noDupeList)
```

`let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}`

Answer:
```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}
var smallestNumber = 10
var secondSmallest = 20

for number in arrayOfNumbers {
if number < smallestNumber {
smallestNumber = number
} else if number < secondSmallest && number > smallestNumber {
secondSmallest = number
}
}

print(secondSmallest)
```

## Question 16

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Answer:
```swift
let range = 0..<1000

for number in range {
if number % 3 == 0 || number % 5 == 0 {
sum += number
}
}

print(sum)
```
